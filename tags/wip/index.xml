      <description>This paper explores the connection between commuting costs and local employment dynamics, exploiting a spatial discontinuity introduced by a reform in France in September 2015. The reform, which reduced the cost of public transportation in selected areas of the Paris region without affecting others, provides a unique opportunity to investigate these dynamics. Using a baseline regression framework that only includes geographical units near each other, I find that areas benefitting from the reform saw a 0.</description>

      <title>Labor Income Shocks Along the Business Cycle</title>

      <description>This paper analyzes the determinants of labor income shocks along the business cycle. My main finding is that sorting between firms and workers is a key component of idiosyncratic risk. Labor income shocks are analyzed through the lenses of a dynamic search-and-matching model, which I estimate using US data. Because of search frictions and mismatches between firms and workers, the laissez-faire equilibrium is not necessarily optimal. My results underline that the government can tame business cycle fluctuations by designing a simple unemployment insurance scheme improving sorting between firms and workers.</description>
