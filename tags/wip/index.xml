      <description>We analyse the consequences of the minimum wage on employment and sorting in a model of the labor market with search frictions, heterogeneous workers and firms, and business cycle fluctuations. This is a joint project with Jeremy Lise and Jean-Marc Robin.</description>

      <title>Spatial Equilibrium and Commuting Costs</title>

      <description>I explore the links between commuting costs and local employment dynamics using a spatial discontinuity introduced by a French reform in September 2015. The reform decreased the cost of public transportation in selected areas of the Paris region, but did not affect other areas. In the baseline regression framework, which only includes units that are geographically close to each other, I find that areas benefiting from the reform experienced a:</description>

      <title>Labor Income Shocks Along the Business Cycle</title>

      <description>This paper analyzes the determinants of labor income shocks along the business cycle. My main finding is that sorting between firms and workers is a key component of idiosyncratic risk. Labor income shocks are analyzed through the lenses of a dynamic search-and-matching model, which I estimate using US data. Because of search frictions and mismatches between firms and workers, the laissez-faire equilibrium is not necessarily optimal. My results underline that the government can tame business cycle fluctuations by designing a simple unemployment insurance scheme improving sorting between firms and workers.</description>
