      <title>Labor Policy in a Dynamic Search-Matching Model with Heterogeneous Workers and Firms</title>

      <description>We analyse the consequences of the minimum wage on employment and sorting in a model of the labor market with search frictions, heterogeneous workers and firms, and business cycle fluctuations. This is a joint project with Jeremy Lise and Jean-Marc Robin.</description>

      <title>Labor Tax in a Dynamic Search-and-Matching Model</title>

      <description>We develop a theoretical framework to evaluate the contribution of different payroll tax schedules to business cycle fluctuations. We build and estimate a dynamic search-and-matching model of the labor market featuring heterogeneous workers, aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks and a non-linear payroll tax schedule. We estimate the model on Italian administrative data for the period 1977-2012 and use our estimated framework to quantitatively evaluate how different payroll tax schedules can amplify business cycle shocks for different types of workers.</description>

      <title>Spatial Equilibrium and Commuting Costs</title>

      <description>I exploit a spatial discontinuity introduced by a French reform in September 2015 to measure the links between commuting costs, employment and location decisions. I find that the reform led to a 2% decrease in the number of unemployed workers registered in the unemployment agency for the municipalities benefiting from the reform. The employment effect is concentrated on long-term unemployed workers. I build a simple spatial search-and-matching to underline the mechanisms at play.</description>

      <title>Labor Income Shocks Along the Business Cycle</title>
      <link>https://julienpascal.github.io/project/laborincomeshocks/</link>

      <description>I show that a dynamic search-and-matching model, in which firms and workers are heterogeneous, possesses the mechanisms to replicate some features the distribution of labor income shocks along the business cycle. I solve for the sticky wage process Ã  la Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002) in the model and Lise and Robin (2017) using a variant of the Krusell-Smith algorithm. I estimate the model using the simulated method of moments on US data, including both employment and wage-related moments.</description>
