      <description>Introduction The Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari-ImohoroÄŸlu economies are the workhorse of modern macroeconomics. In these economies, markets are &amp;ldquo;incomplete&amp;rdquo;. Agents cannot fully insure against risk and decide to self-insure by holding a safe asset to smooth their consumption (see Ljungqvist and Sargent (2018) for a textbook treatment of this topic).
In this post, I consider the model of Aiyagari (1994). While the original model abstracts from aggregate fluctuations, Economists have since developed several techniques to simulate out-of-steady-state dynamics for this class of models.</description>

      <description>In a previous post I presented the BKM algorithm , which can used to approximate solutions of macroeconomic models with aggregate uncertainty and heterogeneous agents. This class of models has been been of great interest for Economists for quite a long time. For instance, Aiyagari (1994) already hinted that taking into consideration heterogeneity along the business cycle is both theoretically important and challenging:
 This class of models may also be useful in resolving various asset return puzzles.</description>
