      <description>This paper introduces new empirical findings concerning the rental housing market in the Paris metropolitan area. Utilizing a unique dataset gathered from online advertisements for Parisian rentals, along with a hedonic model that incorporates both apartment features and property-specific photographs, two main stylized facts are established. First, landlords who offer lower rent—while keeping property features constant— attract a greater number of applicants, consistent with predictions from standard directed search models. Second, a previously unreported trend in landlords&amp;rsquo; pricing strategies is identified: a significant portion employ a two-stage pricing approach, initially setting a high advertised rent and subsequently reducing it after a &amp;lsquo;wait-and-see period, consistent with the &amp;lsquo;slow Dutch auction&amp;rsquo; mechanism already studied in the auction literature and empirically observed in the property sales market.</description>
