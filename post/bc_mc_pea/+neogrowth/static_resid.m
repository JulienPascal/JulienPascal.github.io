% Inputs:
%   T         [#temp variables by 1]  double   vector of temporary terms to be filled by function
%   y         [M_.endo_nbr by 1]      double   vector of endogenous variables in declaration order
%   x         [M_.exo_nbr by 1]       double   vector of exogenous variables in declaration order
%   params    [M_.param_nbr by 1]     double   vector of parameter values in declaration order
%                                              to evaluate the model
%   T_flag    boolean                 boolean  flag saying whether or not to calculate temporary terms
