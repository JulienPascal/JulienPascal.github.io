      <description>In my previous post, I discussed how the the simulated method of moments can be used to estimate parameters without using the likelihood function. This method is useful because many &amp;ldquo;real-life&amp;rdquo; applications result in untractable likelihood functions. In this post, I use the same toy example (estimation of the mean of a mutlivariate normal random variable) and show how to use the parallel computing capabilities of Julia and MomentOpt to speed-up the estimation.</description>

      <description>As Thomas Sargent said:
 &amp;ldquo;A rational expectations equilibrium model is a likelihood function&amp;rdquo;
 However in many cases, the likelihood function is too complicated to be written down in closed form. To estimate the structural parameters of a given model, one can still use Monte-Carlo methods. In this post, I would like to describe the simulated method of moments (SMM), which is a widely used simulation-based estimation technique.</description>

      <title>Solving Bellman Equations by the Collocation Method</title>

      <description>A large class of economic models involves solving for functional equations of the form:
A well known example is the stochastic optimal growth model. An agent owns a consumption good $y$ at time $t$, which can be consumed or invested. Next period&amp;rsquo;s output depends on how much is invested at time $t$ and on a shock $z$ realized at the end of the current period. One can think of a farmer deciding the quantity of seeds to be planted during the spring, taking into account weather forecast for the growing season.</description>

      <title>Solving a simple RBC model in Dynare</title>

      <description>Dynare is a rich software to solve, estimate and analyse rational expectation models. While it was originally designed to solve and estimate DSGE models, Dynare has also recently been used to solve and simulate heterogeneous agents models (see Winberry and Ragot for two very different approaches). Below is a simple example on how to solve and simulate a simple RBC model using Dynare.
A simple model The economy is composed of a representative agent who maximizes his expected discounted sum of utility by choosing consumption $C_t$ and labor $L_t$ for $t=1,&amp;hellip;,\infty$ $$ \sum_{t=1}^{+\infty}\big(\frac{1}{1+\rho}\big)^{t-1} E_t\Big[log(C_t)-\frac{L_t^{1+\gamma}}{1+\gamma}\Big] $$</description>
