      <description>This paper reviews the literature examining the consequences of heterogeneity in macroeconomic modeling, especially within the context of monetary and fiscal policy transmission. This review reveals that heterogeneity can significantly alter the transmission mechanisms of monetary policy in macroeconomic models and suggests possible advantages from collaboration between fiscal and monetary policies. The paper also provides a critical evaluation of various analytical (limited-heterogeneity, history truncation, no-trade equilibrium) and numerical methods (forecasting rules, linearization in state-space or sequence-space, global methods) to solve macroeconomic models with heterogeneity, underscoring how these methods relate to each other, while emphasizing the need for a careful methodological choice based on specific circumstances.</description>

      <title>Rental Housing Market and Directed Search</title>

      <description>This paper introduces new empirical findings concerning the functioning of the rental housing market. Utilizing a unique dataset gathered from online advertisements for Parisian rentals, along with a hedonic model that incorporates both apartment features and property-specific photographs, two main stylized facts are established. First, landlords who offer lower rent, while keeping property features constant, attract a greater number of applicants, consistent with predictions from standard directed search models. Second, a previously unreported trend in landlords&amp;rsquo; pricing strategies is identified: a significant portion employ a two-stage pricing approach, initially setting a high advertised rent and subsequently reducing it after a &amp;ldquo;wait-and-see&amp;rdquo; period, consistent with the slow Dutch auction mechanism already studied in the auction literature and empirically observed in the property sales market.</description>

      <title>Spatial Equilibrium and Commuting Costs</title>

      <description>This paper explores the connection between commuting costs and local employment dynamics, exploiting a spatial discontinuity introduced by a reform in France in September 2015. The reform, which reduced the cost of public transportation in selected areas of the Paris region without affecting others, provides a unique opportunity to investigate these dynamics. Using a baseline regression framework that only includes geographical units near each other, I find that areas benefitting from the reform saw a 0.</description>

      <title>Labor Income Shocks Along the Business Cycle</title>

      <description>This paper analyzes the determinants of labor income shocks along the business cycle. My main finding is that sorting between firms and workers is a key component of idiosyncratic risk. Labor income shocks are analyzed through the lenses of a dynamic search-and-matching model, which I estimate using US data. Because of search frictions and mismatches between firms and workers, the laissez-faire equilibrium is not necessarily optimal. My results underline that the government can tame business cycle fluctuations by designing a simple unemployment insurance scheme improving sorting between firms and workers.</description>
