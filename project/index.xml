      <title>Rental Housing Market and Directed Search</title>

      <description>Using a novel dataset on the rental housing market in the Paris area, I show that the rental housing market is well described by a directed search model. I develop a hedonic pricing model taking into consideration apartmentsâ€™ characteristics and subjective attractiveness using photos and computer vision techniques from the machine learning literature.
To quantify visual attractiveness, I use a convolutional neural network based on a paper by Talebi and Peyman (2018).</description>

      <title>Labor Policy in a Dynamic Search-Matching Model with Heterogeneous Workers and Firms</title>

      <description>We analyse the consequences of the minimum wage on employment and sorting in a model of the labor market with search frictions, heterogeneous workers and firms, and business cycle fluctuations. This is a joint project with Jeremy Lise and Jean-Marc Robin.</description>

      <title>Labor Tax in a Dynamic Search-and-Matching Model</title>

      <description>We develop a theoretical framework to evaluate the contribution of different payroll tax schedules to business cycle fluctuations. We build and estimate a dynamic search-and-matching model of the labor market featuring heterogeneous workers, aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks and a non-linear payroll tax schedule. We estimate the model on Italian administrative data for the period 1977-2012 and use our estimated framework to quantitatively evaluate how different payroll tax schedules can amplify business cycle shocks for different types of workers.</description>

      <title>Spatial Equilibrium and Commuting Costs</title>

      <description>I exploit a spatial discontinuity introduced by a French reform in September 2015 to measure the links between commuting costs, employment and location decisions. In the municipalities benefiting from the reform, I find that the reform led to a 2% decrease in the number of unemployed workers registered in the French unemployment agency. The employment effect is concentrated on long-term unemployed workers. I build a simple spatial search-and-matching to underline the mechanism at play.</description>

      <title>Labor Income Shocks Along the Business Cycle</title>
      <link>https://julienpascal.github.io/project/laborincomeshocks/</link>

      <description>This paper analyzes the determinants of labor income shocks along the business cycle. My main finding is that sorting between firms and workers is a key component of idiosyncratic risk. Labor income shocks are analyzed through the lenses of a dynamic search-and-matching model, which I estimate using US data. Because of search frictions and mismatches between firms and workers, the laissez-faire equilibrium is not necessarily optimal. My results underline that the government can tame business cycle fluctuations by designing a simple unemployment insurance scheme improving sorting between firms and workers.</description>
