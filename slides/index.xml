      <description>Rental Housing Market and Directed Search Introduction Context  Housing shortages in many major cities Rents have surged in big cities worldwide   The median American rent payment rose 61% in real terms between 1960 and 2016 while the median tenantâ€™s income grew by 5%
 Questions  Do we observe asymmetric bargaining power between tenants and landlords?  Data Data Sources  Web scraping: online platform that collects online ads for the Paris market between April and May 2019 I have data on the two sides of the rental housing market:  supply: apartment features, text description and photos demand: number of contacts received by landlords (through the online platform)   Descriptive statistics Ads per city Apartment features Apartment features by city Aesthetic score  Aesthetic score calculated based on photos I use a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the work of Talebi and Milanfar (2018) CNN assigns a score to each photo Ad aesthetic score = median score  Number of photos per ad Density aesthetic score What features are important to predict rent?</description>
