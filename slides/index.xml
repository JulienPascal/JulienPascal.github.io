      <description>Rental Housing Market and Directed Search Introduction Context  Housing shortages in many major cities Rents have surged in big cities worldwide   The median American rent payment rose 61% in real terms between 1960 and 2016 while the median tenant’s income grew by 5%
 Questions  Do we observe asymmetric bargaining power between tenants and landlords?  Data Data Sources  Web scraping: online platform that collects online ads for the Paris market between April and May 2019 I have data on the two sides of the rental housing market:  supply: apartment features, text description and photos demand: number of contacts received by landlords (through the online platform)   Descriptive statistics Ads per city Apartment features Apartment features by city Aesthetic score  Aesthetic score calculated based on photos I use a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the work of Talebi and Milanfar (2018) CNN assigns a score to each photo Ad aesthetic score = median score  Number of photos per ad Density aesthetic score What features are important to predict rent?</description>

      <description>Spatial Equilibrium and Commuting Costs Introduction  The &amp;ldquo;Forfait Toutes Zones&amp;rdquo; (FTZ) entered into force on September 2015 in the Paris area The costs of using public transports decreased for workers living in the outskirts of Paris (zones 3-5) Using the spatial discontinuity generated by the reform, I analyze the links between commuting costs and local employment outcomes  Data Data Sources  Monthly # of workers registered to Pole Emploi at the municipality level: Pole Emploi Demographic and economic characteristics of municipalities and IRIS: INSEE House price index at the municipality level: Chambre des Notaires de Paris Fare area at the IRIS level: Vianavigo Behavior of travelers on the public transport network: STIF  Cost change by fare area Average cost difference by fare area Fare area at the IRIS level Econometrics Main specification $$y_{it} = \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \beta \times \delta_{i,t} + \boldsymbol{\eta} \boldsymbol{x_{i,t}}^{&amp;lsquo;} + \varepsilon_{i,t}$$</description>
